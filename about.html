				<h1>THIS IS ME</h1>
				<p>Hello and welcome. My name is Richard Arnone and I am a graduate from the University of Guelph-Humber with an Honours Bachelor of Applied Arts in Media Studies and a Diploma in Media Communications with an emphasis in Digital Communicatons.<br><br>
I am self-motivated and I enjoy working on my own as well as with others. I take great satisfaction in being able to contribute to projects where my area ofÂ expertise proves useful.<br><br>
Throughout the past seven years I have practiced and honed my skills as a designer. Through education and work experience, I have been able to learn new skills and study design techniques which have shaped my work ethic, process and success.</p>

					<h1>Graphic Design</h1>
					<p>I believe that before your first sketch, you need to understand who your client is and how you can help them achieve their goal. Understanding the needs of your client is the first step towards a successful design.<br><br>
I have acquired extensive knowledge and practical skills with various Adobe Creative Suite programs; namely, Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. With these tools I am able to take concepts and make them a reality.</p>

					<h1>Front End Development</h1>
					<p>It is always exciting to see your designs come to life, especially when it allows for user interaction. With
front end development, you are providing the first impression of what is to be expected. You set the mood for the entirety of the experience.<br><br>
Coding various websites, landing pages and email communications, has allowed me to hone my skills in HTML5, CSS3, Java Script, jQuery
and various content management systems.</p>

				<div class="skillLeft">
					<div style="background-color: red; height: 80px; width: 300px;"></div>
					<h1>Communication</h1>
					<p>Being able to successfully articulate your thoughts is an important skill to possess. From seeking guidance to preparing documents, communication covers a wide range of responsibilities that is important in daily life.<br><br>
During the course of my education, personal learning experiences and work experience, I have continued to improve upon my communication skills both verbally and written.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="skillRight">
					<div style="background-color: red; height: 80px; width: 300px;"></div>
					<h1>Team Oriented</h1>
					<p>Working as a team is a substantial aspect of day to day operations. Success is much easier to acquire when every step of the way is supported, respected and kept in focus.<br><br>
Through team collaborations, tight deadlines and late nights, I have experienced first-hand, the importance of working with my peers to ensure nothing but the best is produced for our clients.</p>
